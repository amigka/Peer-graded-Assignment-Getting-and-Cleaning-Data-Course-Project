#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

For this assignment an R script has been created called run_analysis.R, that does the followings:

1. Downloads the dataset

2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

3. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

4. Converts the activity id to activity name

5. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names

6. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the mean per subject and activity. The final result is extracted in the Tidy.txt file.
