Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

For this assignment an R script has been created called run_analysis.R, that does the followings:

Downloads the dataset

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

Converts the activity id to activity name

Labels the data set with descriptive variable names

Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair

The end result is shown in the file Tidy.txt.
